# Mode Switcher

This app lets you quickly switch your MacBook’s display mode between mirror and extended desktop.
Use Command + Shift + 0 to toggle between modes. 

macOS may currently warn that this app is “not safe” because it hasn’t been signed yet.
If you’re unsure about its safety, you can review the source code yourself.

Cheers.
